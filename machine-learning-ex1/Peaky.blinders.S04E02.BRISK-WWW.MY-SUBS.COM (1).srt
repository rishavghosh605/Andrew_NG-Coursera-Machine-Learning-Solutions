﻿1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
You can't live like this another year.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,740
Tommy, you've never even
seen Arthur's kid.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,270
Nor John and Esme's.

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,530
I'm staying with Polly.

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,750
She's in a bad way.
I'll get through to her.

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,460
The union convenor
causing all the trouble,

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,760
her name's Jessie Eden.

8
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,350
I will conduct myself as a businessman...

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,560
Who says "sweetheart"?

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,970
Today, everyone in the family
received one of these.

11
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,660
Changretta knows where we all live.

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,990
We need to be together at a place
even they won't dare to come.

13
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,360
You mean back home?

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,570
This is the New York Mafia
we're talking about.

15
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,230
And we're the Peaky Blinders.

16
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,610
We're not the Peaky Blinders
unless we're together.

17
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,210
- And what's the purpose of your visit?
- Pleasure.

18
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,750
Please, can we get some help here?

19
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,750
Please? It's all right, Michael.

20
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,880
It's all right, Michael.

21
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,430
It's all right, Michael.
You're going to be OK.

22
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,900
Don't leave us now. Just keep breathing.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,000
No. No.

24
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,070
I don't want fucking kids
in here. I want soldiers.

25
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,310
I don't want fucking kids
who joined us for the sport.

26
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,890
All right. Get out. Go on. Go.

27
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,150
- I want men who served in here.
- All right, Pol.

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,260
God, please, don't take my son.

29
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,290
Mrs Gray, please.

30
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,690
- Please, don't. God, don't take my son.
- Pol.

31
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,800
Pol. He's in good hands.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,890
- God, please, don't take my son.
- Polly.

33
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,140
Pol? Pol?

34
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,190
Damn, fuck those bastards responsible.

35
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,610
All right. Let them do
their job, all right?

36
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,810
Let them do their job. I'll get soldiers.

37
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,620
I'll be back. I'll be back.

38
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,570
Is it him?

39
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,910
Yeah.

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,970
On his own doorstep.

41
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,800
His own fucking doorstep.

42
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,610
All right, get out.

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,030
And you, out.

44
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,010
Poor John.

45
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,550
Fucking John.

46
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,100
"In the bleak midwinter..."

47
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,150
We promised, Arthur.

48
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,530
No, I can't...

49
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,850
In the hole, we promised.

50
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,790
I can't look at him...

51
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,120
Come here, brother.

52
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,920
Come here.

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,970
Come on, come here.

54
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,880
Oh, man.

55
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,030
Now, say it.

56
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,510
Say it, brother.

57
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,390
"In the bleak midwinter..."

58
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,770
You're cursed, and I curse you again!

59
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,790
And again! And again!

60
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,050
- Esme...
- No!

61
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,350
Come on. Come here. Come on.

62
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,080
Leave me with him.

63
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,590
You've spoken to him.

64
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,700
Now it's my turn.

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,040
Arthur.

66
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,800
No peace for either of you...ever.

67
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,230
Our stuff will stay with me.

68
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,100
I'm taking the children on the road,

69
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,790
to live with decent people.

70
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,240
They'll never know the
cursed side of this family.

71
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,500
We're done with them, John.

72
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,590
Tommy, they're gathered.

73
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,460
John is dead.

74
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,710
Esme has gone on the road with the Lees.

75
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,150
She's taken the kids.

76
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,850
Michael is badly wounded.

77
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,210
They say it's 60-40 in his favour.

78
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,830
There's no number, there's no percentages.

79
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,070
There's only the hand.

80
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,630
The hand beneath him stops him falling.

81
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,160
I spoke to someone.

82
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,800
My son'll live.

83
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,630
Michael and John were shot
because we killed someone.

84
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,170
Vicente Changretta.

85
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,800
His son, Luca, has come to take revenge.

86
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,580
Men from New York and Sicily
here in Birmingham.

87
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,280
These men will not leave our city
until our whole family is dead.

88
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,240
That's how it works - an eye for an eye.

89
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,640
It's called vendetta.

90
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,960
The bullet's been written.

91
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,470
It says "LUCA".

92
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,670
When the time comes...

93
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,840
..And it will come...

94
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,340
..He, as the oldest brother...

95
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,410
I will put this bullet
into his fucking head.

96
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,430
There's been some bad blood between us.

97
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,730
Polly, please.

98
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,300
Until this business is settled,
we stay together...

99
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,350
..And we stay here.

100
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,130
Small Heath, Bordesley,
Hay Mills, down to Greet.

101
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,970
We know every face and every
man is a soldier in this army.

102
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,860
These men are professionals,
they're good at what they do,

103
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,600
so we're going to need more than we have.

104
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,350
I've sent a message to Aberama Gold.

105
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,600
No.

106
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,440
No, Tom.

107
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,580
I'll get you 50 Lee boys. Good men, Tom.

108
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,540
I don't need good men, Johnny.
For this, I need bad men.

109
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,020
Tommy, his people are fuckin' savages.
You know? Heathens, Tom.

110
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,080
They don't even let them in the fair,

111
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,540
so they come and steal our horses.

112
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,660
You know, stealing from their own, Tom.

113
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,420
So this the plan, Thomas?

114
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,970
This is the plan?

115
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,870
A bullet with a name on it,

116
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,540
help from a bunch of savages?

117
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,270
We're going to go on the offensive.

118
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,530
I've spoken to Moss.

119
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,930
- Moss!
- I've spoken to Moss.

120
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,890
Moss is putting out word...

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,690
..Eyes and ears so we can find 'em.

122
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,960
Yet the truth is, the police
are busy with the revolution.

123
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,510
Moss says they're expecting strikes

124
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,760
and riots when the weather gets warmer.

125
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,520
The Bolsheviks are planning...

126
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,950
The Bolsheviks couldn't plan
a fucking picnic.

127
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,760
- He's reading the wrong papers.
- Ada!

128
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,220
Real or not real, the coppers
don't give a fuck about us.

129
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,320
All right?

130
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,000
Which means...

131
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
..That here today, in this room,

132
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,560
we have to agree to
end this war between us.

133
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,090
Take a vote.

134
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,390
Peace.

135
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,230
I was never a part of this, but...peace.

136
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,270
Peace.

137
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,630
Peace.

138
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,020
Peace.

139
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,750
Shut up, Finn.

140
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,710
Why can't I say "Peace"?

141
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,300
Arthur, let him have his say.

142
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,430
Finn, sit at the table.

143
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,140
Little bastard.

144
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,910
They're sending us fucking kids,
Sergeant Major...

145
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,210
to do men's work.

146
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,860
My son's not here to speak...

147
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,570
so I'll speak on behalf of us both.

148
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,140
Truce.

149
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,040
Five for peace, two for truce,
one abstention.

150
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,100
Let's get on with the war.

151
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,920
Curly, here we are.

152
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,360
Here, catch.

153
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,730
Right. Right, move them, boys.

154
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,230
Unload, unload!

155
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,280
Hat.

156
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,000
Blues and Villa goalkeeper?

157
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,980
Dan Tremelling plays
in goal for the Blues,

158
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,680
and Tommy Jackson for the Villa.

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,860
Fair enough.

160
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,050
- Charlie?
- What is it, Curly?

161
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,840
We've run out of bullets, Charlie.

162
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,570
We need more ammunition!

163
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,890
More ammunition!

164
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,960
Johnny, more ammo.

165
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,980
We're like sitting ducks
here, if the wops come.

166
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,160
Yeah, well, Tommy said
we should do it in the open.

167
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,500
This is how John wanted to go.

168
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,100
On the smoke.

169
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,170
But the truth is,

170
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,430
we died together once before.

171
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,790
Arthur, me...

172
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,790
Danny Whizz-Bang,

173
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,990
Freddie Thorne, Jeremiah, and John.

174
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,710
We were cut off from
the retreat, no bullets left,

175
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,750
waiting for the Prussian cavalry
to come, and to finish us off.

176
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,740
And while we waited...

177
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,750
Jeremiah said we should
sing In The Bleak Midwinter.

178
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,490
But we were spared - the enemy never came.

179
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,710
And we all agreed...

180
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,830
That everything after that was extra...

181
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,060
And when our time came,
we would all remember.

182
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,850
You remember that God spared you.

183
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,680
But what did you do with
the extra time that he gave you,

184
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,690
eh, Thomas?

185
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,660
At ease. At ease.

186
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,550
Do not return fire!

187
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,550
I repeat - do not return fire!

188
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,850
Stand down.

189
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,640
The men doing the firing are on our side.

190
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,470
I took the trouble

191
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,410
of getting an invitation to Aberama Gold.

192
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,930
Oh, fuck. Now it's begun.

193
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,210
You put us out in the open on purpose.

194
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,050
You used John's funeral
fire as a fucking beacon.

195
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,750
- We were never in any danger, Polly.
- You set a trap.

196
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,760
Finn? Finn?!

197
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,210
Go to the yard and light the fires.

198
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,070
You set a trap with us as fucking bait.

199
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,060
Who's dead?

200
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,780
Our enemies.

201
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,610
- Who's dead?
- Want to know, Pol?

202
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,310
Two fucking local Italians
heard about the vendetta,

203
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,540
tried to make a fucking names
for themselves - that's who.

204
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,650
We got word to them about the funeral

205
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,100
the where, the when.

206
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,820
Told them where to stand for the best shot.

207
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,260
And Aberama Gold will do the rest.

208
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,980
That's the language of vendetta

209
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,200
they take one of ours,
we take two of theirs.

210
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,410
You used your own brother's funeral.

211
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,890
When did we vote on this, Tommy?

212
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,850
Curly, get a boat ready to
take the bodies to the city,

213
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,290
and another boat for anyone...

214
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,070
anyone who wants no more part of this.

215
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,880
Cos this is how it's going to be.

216
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,360
Polly!

217
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,550
I'm not staying for this, Arthur.

218
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm going home.

219
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,280
Oh, yeah. Home's 57
Watery Lane. You go there...

220
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Lock the doors, you wait for me.

221
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,020
- Key to number 57.
- I'm going home to the country.

222
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,570
You will stay here until it's over.

223
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,370
Take the fucking key, Linda.

224
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,140
Look, away from here, you
are a weakness to all of us.

225
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,140
They will take you hostage, and the baby.

226
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,530
They will use the baby.

227
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,650
Take it. Put the kettle on.

228
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,530
Wait for your husband.

229
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,470
The only way any of you
Shelbys will leave this place

230
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,700
is on a cloud of smoke, like John.

231
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,340
Well, you're a Shelby now, too, Linda.

232
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,070
500 each, 1,000 for the brace.

233
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,950
Where do you want them?

234
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,230
Charlie, take them to the yard.

235
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,670
Not too far, not too deep, Curly.

236
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,260
We need the message to get through.

237
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,380
OK, Tom.

238
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,260
Finn, you go with him.

239
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,400
Go on. Go with him.

240
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,980
Oh, Tom? Tell Johnny
to save me some goose, please.

241
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,490
On your feet.

242
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,750
Wait outside.

243
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,740
Hello, Mum.

244
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,580
They said you'd be out cold.

245
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,730
No, don't move.

246
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,550
The doctor said they'd
sewn you up like a football.

247
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,150
What else did he say?

248
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,350
He said you took four bullets.

249
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,820
Only one was live.

250
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,160
One was a ricochet...

251
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,990
...Two were already spent.

252
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,150
Two had passed through John.

253
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,560
The last thing I remember was his face.

254
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,620
I watched him go.

255
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,650
Where's Tommy?

256
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,710
Oh, don't worry about Tommy.
Just get better.

257
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,810
Where is he?

258
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,290
Tommy's back.

259
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,480
We're all back.

260
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,450
The Garrison, Watery Lane, Charlie's.

261
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,270
I need a cigarette.

262
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,350
No.

263
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,630
I've made a decision.

264
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,610
- Give me a cigarette, Mum.
- It's not allowed.

265
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,940
It's not allowed?

266
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,180
I've decided we're going
to get away. Yeah?

267
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,150
Just me and you.

268
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,890
Australia.

269
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,420
And I've been to the Cunard
office and I got a magazine.

270
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,290
America's no good,
because that's where they are,

271
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,380
but there's no Italians in Australia.

272
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,070
I think there are, Mum.

273
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,970
Bad ones, I mean.

274
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,550
Have you stopped taking
those prison tablets?

275
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,400
- Don't you worry about me.
- I do.

276
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,200
Just you get better.

277
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,170
The doctor says it'll be five weeks.

278
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,730
Then, you'll be up and walking.

279
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,680
Now, there's a boat that leaves
on February the 13th.

280
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,580
Tell Tommy I need to see him.

281
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,060
Tell him to bring a gun small
enough to fit in the chamber pot,

282
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,990
- in case they come back.
- No, I've banned Tommy from coming.

283
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,700
Are the factories going
back to work tomorrow?

284
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,260
Just forget the fucking factories.

285
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,010
Is there any word of them
going out on strike?

286
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,610
We're going to Australia. It'll
just be you, me, and your sister.

287
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,290
Cos I've found out where she's buried -

288
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,920
it's somewhere outside Melbourne.

289
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,120
Listen, Mum.

290
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,870
I'm going to get better slowly...

291
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,880
...But you need to get better fast.

292
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,390
Without you, he falls apart,
and without him...

293
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,000
Without him, they'll take us all.

294
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,230
You've got to get us through this.

295
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,200
Then, I promise...

296
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,050
...I'll board that train with you
and we'll go to Australia.

297
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,970
I like your yard, Mr Strong.

298
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,110
How much would you take for it?

299
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,830
It's not for sale.

300
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,580
Not for sale?

301
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,750
Ok.

302
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,480
I just took a look round.

303
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,720
I like this place.

304
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,390
Fire for melting silver,

305
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,900
canal to get it away.

306
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,210
How much?

307
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,400
Nothing you see is for sale, Mr Gold.

308
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,010
Oh, everything is for sale.

309
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,190
Everything.

310
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,140
You tell Mr Strong
I'm going to buy his yard.

311
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,080
This yard has been in his
family since they settled.

312
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,420
But I have decided to make
it part of our deal.

313
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,410
Charlie?

314
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,250
Charlie, come here.

315
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,640
We're going to spin a coin
for your yard, Charlie.

316
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,880
You're going to what?

317
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,490
If it's heads,

318
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,720
Abby here takes all of this...
with my blessing.

319
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,350
Tommy.

320
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,870
And if it's tails...

321
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,820
...I fuck your daughter, Mr Gold.

322
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,240
You have three daughters, I hear...

323
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,290
...And Esmeralda is the eldest,
and also the prettiest,

324
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,530
so I'll have her.

325
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,140
So make her part of the deal
and spin her against the yard.

326
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,360
Tommy, for fuck sake.

327
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,300
Here, toss the coin, Mr Gold.

328
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,610
No.

329
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,420
Please don't believe this is a joke.

330
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,760
The coin to us is sacred. Yes, Arthur?

331
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,950
Sacred.

332
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,680
If you toss that coin, you
take a bet before witnesses.

333
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,690
And if I win...

334
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,760
Then, we'll insist that
the terms of this agreement,

335
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,530
the wager, are fulfilled.

336
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,350
Toss the coin, Mr Gold.

337
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,700
Tommy Shelby OBE...

338
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,700
...No wager today.

339
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,250
But with this penny, I will buy
a flower to put on your grave...

340
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,620
...When the time comes.

341
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,860
And before that time,

342
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,050
please don't again

343
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:40,110
disrespect my friends or
their valued property.

344
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,760
We missed Christmas - let's have it now.

345
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,180
Peace on earth, good will to all men.

346
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,450
Rum, Curly.

347
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,330
Toast to my brother, John.
Raise your glasses, all of you.

348
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,220
Raise 'em up, all of you.

349
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,520
- John Shelby.
- Cheers.

350
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,860
I got wire, I got chains,
I got steel rods - now what?

351
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,440
Right, put the steel rods
up the geese's arse there,

352
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,760
and then you put those
steel rods above the fire,

353
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,380
spinning the rod to stop
the bird from burning.

354
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,810
You did get potatoes, Charlie?

355
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,040
No, I didn't get fucking potatoes.
What's the matter with you?

356
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,140
I don't want that bastard, Aberama Gold,

357
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,580
putting it around that
we live like didicois.

358
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,150
I want him to see that we
live proper, that we eat proper,

359
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,370
in the proper way.

360
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,340
What the fuck are you talking about?

361
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,330
I'll get the potatoes meself.

362
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,870
Never thought my high-fucking-heels
from Paris would be stepping

363
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,050
through the horse shit
of Small Heath ever again.

364
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,530
Temporary, Polly.

365
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,990
Yeah, until hell freezes over.

366
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,490
How's Michael?

367
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,240
You said eight men from
New York, seven from Sicily,

368
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,910
at £500 each.

369
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,200
Of course, you can afford it.

370
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,320
Most, we'll do ourselves.

371
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,820
How many of your factories
are in the safe territories?

372
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,140
70%
70%.

373
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,820
Shelby Company Ltd will
continue to manufacture.

374
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,640
Lizzie says it's only whores these days.

375
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,870
Yeah.

376
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,200
Have them smuggled in, I suppose?

377
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,100
I need you back, Polly.

378
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,950
Paying whores for sex,
paying killers to kill...

379
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,270
Yeah - nothing for nothing.

380
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,600
Poor Thomas.

381
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,630
You know, our mother went this way -

382
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,610
spirits and ghosts, tablets,

383
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,980
fucking... fucking seances

384
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,990
scaring us kids halfway to fucking death.

385
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,980
Yeah, well, I'm not going that way.

386
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,190
Cos in the smoke, I realised something.

387
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,570
I'm just like you now,

388
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,830
you and Arthur.

389
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,050
I was dead in that noose,
and then I was saved.

390
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,450
So everything from now on is extra.

391
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,060
But what I didn't
understand until today...

392
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,800
Is when you're dead already...

393
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,530
You're free.

394
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,650
Fucking love it.

395
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,440
I'll help you, cos Michael
wants me to help you.

396
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,620
Starting now.

397
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,540
Get your whores vetted by Lizzie,
they'll use your weakness.

398
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,710
Don't take any new men on in

399
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,040
the factories unless
you know their families.

400
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,910
And your new friend,

401
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,890
Mr Aberama Gold...

402
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,510
He wants something other than just money.

403
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,090
I see things in the air around people,

404
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,770
it's not just the tablets.

405
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,010
It's real.

406
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,760
Ask him what he really wants.

407
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,200
She's a fine beast, this one.

408
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,720
Nothing you see is for sale, Mr Shelby.

409
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,950
Your grandfather camped
with mine for a while.

410
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,620
Yeah. That didn't last.

411
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,150
No, it ended badly...

412
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,880
In a pub called the Wenlock.

413
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,360
We were owed money. Still are.

414
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,780
Other than money and a scrapyard
that's clearly not for sale...

415
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,120
What is it that you want from me, Mr Gold?

416
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,850
How do you know I want anything from you?

417
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,600
Well, because my company treasurer

418
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,530
is a certified accountant,

419
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,570
and also, apparently, a witch.

420
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,790
You're a sporting man...

421
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,330
Yes, I am.

422
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,720
And a gambling man.

423
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,990
Bonnie, take off your shirt.

424
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,070
What I want from you, Mr Shelby,

425
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,370
is for you to take a gamble on him.

426
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,880
I want you to help my son
achieve his ambition.

427
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,040
What ambition might that be?

428
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,470
Who is it?

429
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,890
Inspector Moss.

430
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,830
I'm looking for Tommy.

431
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,270
He's at Charlie's.

432
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,490
But I wouldn't go there,
some bad men have arrived.

433
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,390
Yes, I've heard...

434
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,340
Be drunk by now... or worse.

435
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,040
Can you take a message?

436
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,500
The intelligence service
in London have sent seven officers

437
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,310
up to Birmingham to take
over the investigation

438
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,550
into the Communists and seditionists.

439
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,800
They've got a list of people
of great interest and, erm,

440
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,410
top of that list is
Ada Thorne, formerly Shelby.

441
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,920
Now, they seem to think that
she came back from New York

442
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,600
to organise the revolution in Birmingham.

443
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,070
Well, tell them they're wrong.

444
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,590
Ada Shelby's now firmly back
in place in the family business.

445
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,430
Thing is, when you get
a mark against your name,

446
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,110
it's very hard to shift it.

447
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,670
They will come looking for her.

448
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,350
Well, tell them there's a queue.

449
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,230
Everybody wants a Shelby.

450
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,840
Mrs Shelby...

451
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,810
These are military men,

452
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,140
no less dangerous than any Italians.

453
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,200
You tell Tommy.

454
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,110
I think he'll understand.

455
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,920
I'll say good night to you, then.

456
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,060
Hello, Curly.

457
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,200
- Oh, hello...
- I'm here to collect Mr Shelby's horse.

458
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,150
I'm a little early, I think.

459
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,260
A-Are you going to train
the horse to race?

460
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,520
Yes.

461
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,250
D-Don't use the crop,

462
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,770
she's very gentle.

463
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,030
I won't.

464
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,220
I-I...

465
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,390
How is Mr Shelby?

466
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,850
Well, now he's got
the Americans after him,

467
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,810
- he's a bit hard on people.
- The Americans?

468
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,530
Yeah, they call them the Mafia.

469
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,640
Dear God.

470
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,520
Yeah, there's 15 of them.
Yeah, they want to kill us all.

471
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,160
But we've got guns and
grenades and Aunt Polly's back,

472
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,640
so it's going to be OK. Yeah.

473
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,180
I-I'll get the horse.

474
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,560
Mr Shelby, thank God you're back.

475
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,380
We've got real trouble.

476
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,590
What meetings do I have today?

477
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,980
Erm, well, there's a supplier
from Coventry at ten,

478
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,300
the convenor of the
boilermakers union at 11,

479
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,140
and then Chamber of Commerce at one.

480
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,240
But that isn't the thing.

481
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,630
Right, clear a space here,
move this car back

482
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,640
and then 100 feet of rope and a bell.

483
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,690
- Rope?
- Yep, and a bell.

484
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,650
Mr Shelby, this place is about to explode.

485
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,640
Rope and a bell, Devlin. Ronnie, this way.

486
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,190
Yes, Mr Shelby.

487
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,130
Oh, by the way, the revolution's
scheduled to begin at noon.

488
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,750
Here he is - Billy Mills.

489
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,230
Former heavyweight champion,
Staffordshire, Warwickshire

490
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,910
and Worcestershire. Hello, Billy.

491
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,940
Yeah, and now I work for you, Mr Shelby,

492
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,700
for not enough money.

493
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,480
All right.

494
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,310
That enough for you?

495
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,810
- Enough for what?
- There's someone here wants to fight you.

496
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,830
Bonnie Gold! Come here, son.

497
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,840
I'm a heavyweight.

498
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,710
He's a welterweight, at best.

499
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,670
Nevertheless, he wants to fight you.

500
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,090
Yeah, and when I damage him,
the Blinders will take my eyes.

501
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,440
No comeback, Billy. It's just
a fight, Queensberry rules.

502
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,740
- When?
- Now.

503
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,410
- Where?
- Here.

504
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,650
Right, you lot, come here.

505
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,580
Let's make it interesting.

506
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,690
Come place a wager with me.

507
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,290
I'll give you good odds.

508
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,380
I'll give you good odds on the boy,

509
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,140
even better on the big lad.

510
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,590
£2, there you go. What you want?

511
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,440
Bonnie. Come here, son.

512
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,770
Your boy knows he can hit back, right?

513
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,830
I told him, in the professional game,

514
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,170
people want their money's worth.

515
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,790
Don't win too fast.

516
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,440
But if you've seen enough...

517
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,570
Finish it, Bonnie!

518
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,870
Fuck me. That was a punch.

519
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,970
What's he got, horseshoes
in those gloves, or what?

520
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,170
Nope. Just his dad's strength
and his mother's temper.

521
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,830
- Does he have fits?
- No.

522
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,630
- Asthma?
- No.

523
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,400
- How's he cut?
- No-one's cut him yet, but his skin's thick.

524
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,530
- Does he drink?
- Porter. Sometimes.

525
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,790
How many fights?

526
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,790
25 bare-knuckle, all knockouts,

527
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,190
five with gloves in pastures.
All knockouts.

528
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,020
Against Romany fighters?

529
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,490
That's why they won't let us
in the fairs no more

530
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,390
he keeps winning.

531
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,850
I could fight a fucking tree
and knock it out, Mr Shelby.

532
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,940
- I like him. I like...
- Mrs Eden's waiting upstairs.

533
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,820
All right, I'll be there
in a minute. Arthur.

534
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,160
Mr Shelby's on his way.

535
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,650
Fight in the workshop?

536
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,420
No. No, just a bit of sport.

537
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,570
Do you want more tea?

538
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,290
No. What kind of sport?

539
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,550
Sport between men, Mrs Eden.

540
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,300
Actually, I'm Miss Eden.

541
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,960
Be patient. A good man will come.

542
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,080
What do you think?

543
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,860
Don't know, it was over fast.

544
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,350
Yeah, but you can tell, aye?

545
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,320
I'll give him to the Irish boys
in Digbeth, they can teach him.

546
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,690
Yeah, and then what?

547
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,570
We promote him. Big money in London.

548
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,990
New York, if he's good.

549
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,620
We control him, run the book.

550
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,800
Control the odds. Like a horse.

551
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,960
Control when he wins, when he loses.

552
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,000
Alfie Solomons runs a fighter.

553
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,060
He says it's fucking money for nothing.

554
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,820
Fighting's been good for us,

555
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,540
better if we know who's going to win.

556
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,100
We've a lot going on, though, Tom.

557
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,990
Yeah. That's why it'd be good
to have the kid around.

558
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,580
If we take the fucking kid on,

559
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,640
one day he may end up
fucking taking a bullet for you.

560
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,390
Can't afford to lose
another brother, can I?

561
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,090
No horses like him, so he's all right.

562
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,990
Come on.

563
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,910
All right. We'll do it.

564
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,920
We need to do a deal about money.

565
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,560
Yeah. Speak to my accountant.

566
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,760
- The witch?
- The witch.

567
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,540
So when will be my first real
fight be, do you think, Mr Shelby?

568
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,070
Well, as soon as we can find men

569
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,000
stupid enough to get in the ring with you.

570
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,270
God help him.

571
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,630
There you go, Bonnie.

572
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,270
You're a Peaky Blinder now, son.

573
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,440
There you go.

574
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,050
The lion's share.

575
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,390
Thank you.

576
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,210
Mr Shelby, I understand
you've had a bereavement.

577
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,900
I'm here to talk business.

578
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,340
- Then I'll be blunt.
- And as will I.

579
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,440
What you're doing here is robbery.

580
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,870
Every man is free to leave.

581
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,080
You cut five shillings
from the weekly wage.

582
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,620
And you said, if I did that,

583
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,640
you'd bring every man and women

584
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,790
in all my factories out on strike.

585
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,600
Yes.

586
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,580
Do you have a whistle?

587
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,020
If so, blow it.

588
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,950
I thought at least we
might have a discussion,

589
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,600
as I do with other owners.

590
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,020
I'm not other owners.

591
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,610
No.

592
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,910
You believe because coal is expensive

593
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,640
and it's been a cold winter,

594
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,900
and because wages have been
cut over these past 12 months,

595
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:43,860
you think cos of all that
nobody will walk out on strike,

596
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,280
cos no-one can afford to.

597
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,280
And, until recently,
that would have been true.

598
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,920
But something has changed this past year.

599
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,120
A cold wind from the East.

600
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,760
People are not afraid any more.

601
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,090
I have it on very good authority

602
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,530
that the Bolsheviks couldn't
organise a fucking picnic.

603
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,200
You know, Mr Shelby,

604
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,020
it's almost as if you want trouble.

605
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,720
If the rule of law in Birmingham

606
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,710
were to break down during
this... period of turmoil

607
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,530
for my family, then, yes,

608
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,160
that would indeed have its benefits...

609
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,050
..For reasons you could not understand.

610
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,650
I've heard rumours.

611
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,390
Sport between men.

612
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,040
Just blow your fucking whistle, eh?

613
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,240
Tools down, we got to clear it...

614
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,080
Right, come on, you lot,
put your tools down. We're outside.

615
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,310
Go on.

616
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,580
Just leave it.

617
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,230
Just leave it, let's get out.

618
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,380
Everyone out.

619
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,120
I said, everyone out.

620
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,200
Stop working, immediately.

621
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,110
Yeah, come in.

622
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,630
I did say this would happen.

623
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,860
Who's next?

624
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:13,200
he's a delegate from the
European Council for Trade.

625
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,150
He's here to talk about the
import of car parts to France.

626
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,200
Right.

627
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,950
He's come all the way from Paris.

628
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,040
But, given the circumstances,
I can send him away.

629
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,690
Given what circumstances? Send him in.

630
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,560
Mr Shelby, this is
Monsieur Paz, from Paris.

631
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,000
I heard you had trouble.

632
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,770
It's good of you to see me.

633
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:10,680
You just came from Paris, eh?

634
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,000
You know Paris?

635
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,380
I left Paris in a cattle truck.

636
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,580
They said you were French.

637
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,660
No, I came here from Paris...

638
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,720
..That does not mean I'm French.

639
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,470
Guess where I'm from.

640
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,460
Well, in my cattle truck in Paris...

641
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,670
..There were American soldiers.

642
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,900
We played cards.

643
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,540
They sound like you.

644
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,730
Did you win?

645
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,230
You didn't come on a train.

646
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,440
Your suit is pressed,
your shoes are clean.

647
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,780
Where do you get your suits made?

648
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,740
I have a tailor...

649
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,310
..In New York City.

650
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,250
Look...

651
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,340
Fenacci. Italian.

652
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,190
He's my uncle.

653
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,340
He makes suits in a
basement in Mott Street.

654
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:46,370
He is my uncle, so every
stitch is stitched with blood.

655
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,800
I heard you dress well, Mr Shelby.

656
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,110
But now I see...

657
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,040
..Not so well as me.

658
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,070
You know, I have uncles as well...

659
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,210
..But they're not the sort
of men who would, uh...

660
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:19,100
..Who would work in a basement
with a needle and thread...

661
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,700
..Mr Changretta.

662
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,170
I am surprised how easy it was
to get into a room with you.

663
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,110
And now?

664
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,210
And now...

665
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,850
And now you should know
that during the trouble

666
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,710
you had earlier on your factory floor,

667
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:57,290
I sent an accomplice
into your office in overalls.

668
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,120
He found your gun...

669
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,490
..And unloaded it.

670
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,360
Arthur Shelby...

671
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,080
..Polly Gray....

672
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,050
..Michael Gray...

673
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,700
..John Shelby...

674
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,040
..Spent.

675
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,690
Ada Thorne...

676
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,890
..And, finally...

677
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,200
..Tommy Shelby.

678
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,780
None of you will survive.

679
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,420
Your level of security is pitiful...

680
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,160
..And we are an organisation

681
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,130
of a different dimension.

682
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,100
I could have killed you
when I walked through the door.

683
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,820
But, you see...

684
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,320
..I want you to be the last.

685
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:33,570
I want you to be alive
after your entire family is dead...

686
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,480
..Cos my mother says

687
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,020
that is what'll hurt you the most.

688
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,690
You people have traditions
of honour. As do we.

689
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,850
Instead of sending you a black hand,

690
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:59,200
I could have had you killed
in the night without knowing why.

691
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,570
But I want you to know why.

692
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,720
And I want to suggest to you

693
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,270
that we fight this vendetta with honour.

694
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,990
No civilians. No children.

695
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,240
No police.

696
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,880
Welcome to Birmingham, Mr Changretta.

697
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,240
Grazie.

698
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,760
That smell. I'll miss it.

699
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,260
What, the shit house?

700
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,930
Nah.

701
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,720
I don't know what it is.

702
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,650
Birmingham, I suppose.

703
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,380
Small Heath.

704
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,300
That smell.

705
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,590
The smell brings it back.

706
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,490
Where's John, do you think, Tom?

707
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,180
Fuck knows.

708
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,480
He's gone, though,

709
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,150
like a hole behind your head.

710
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,210
I thought you thought there was a heaven.

711
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,120
No.

712
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:37,780
More like hell for our John.

713
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,590
Nah, neither one.

714
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,570
